Subject: Invoice Discrepancy - Urgent

Hello Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently received Invoice #12345 dated 2025-05-15 from your company, but I noticed some discrepancies in the billing amounts. The total billed is $1,200, but based on the line items, it should be $1,150.

Could you please review and confirm the correct amount? This is quite urgent as we need to process payments by the end of this week.

Thank you for your prompt assistance.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
